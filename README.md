# Minimal-Exam-Generator
A minimal web-based exam generator that allows teachers or students to create randomized practice exams from a simple CSV file containing questions and point values. The app automatically generates a set of questions that match an exact total score (e.g., 50 points) and exports the result as a PDF.
